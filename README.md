The aim of this project is to analyze death patterns due to various parameters and which parameter causes the highest death rate. We would like to analyze how a country's industrial and economical growth is affecting the death rate. Through visualization, we were able to gain insights about the death rate in developed and underdeveloped countries. We  explored death patterns in following areas:
