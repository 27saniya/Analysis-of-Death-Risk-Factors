## Goal
The aim of this project is to analyze death patterns due to various parameters and which parameter causes the highest death rate. We would like to analyze how a country's industrial and economical growth is affecting the death rate. Through visualization, we shall be able to gain insights about the death rate in developed and underdeveloped countries. We will be mainly exploring death patterns in following areas:
-  Child mortality: Non-exclusive breastfeeding, Discontinued breastfeeding, Child wasting, Child stunting, Low birth weight for gestation.
-  Lifestyle choices: Alcohol or Drug usage, Smoking, Low physical activity, Unsafe sex, etc.
- Dietary habits: Low healthy Diet, Vitamin deficiency, Cholesterol, BMI, Blood pressure, etc.
- Pollution: Air pollution, Unsafe sanitation, Unsafe water source, etc.
It will be interesting to observe if there is any correlation between any of the above parameters with respect to the number of deaths. Predictions can also be made for the future years to see the trend of the death rates.
